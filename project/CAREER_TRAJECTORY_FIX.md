# Career Trajectory Prediction Fix

## Problem
The career trajectory prediction was failing with the error:
```
Career trajectory prediction failed: Error: Failed to parse trajectory response
at CareerTrajectoryPredictor.predictCareerTrajectory (line 102)
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred because:
1. The AI response parsing was too strict and would throw errors instead of gracefully falling back
2. The service would crash if Vertex AI wasn't properly configured
3. JSON parsing didn't handle various response formats from the AI model

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Improved Error Handling
- Added input validation before making AI calls
- Replaced error throwing with graceful fallback to generated responses
- Added timeout protection for AI requests (30 seconds)

### 2. Enhanced JSON Parsing
- Improved `safeParseJson` method to handle multiple response formats:
  - Markdown code blocks (```json)
  - Extra text before/after JSON
  - Malformed JSON responses
  - Empty responses
- Added better bracket matching for complex JSON structures

### 3. Graceful Configuration Handling
- Modified constructor to not crash when Vertex AI isn't configured
- Added `isConfigured` flag to track service availability
- Automatically uses fallback mode when AI service is unavailable

### 4. Better Logging
- Added warning messages instead of errors for missing configuration
- Added debug information for parsing failures
- Improved error context for troubleshooting

## Result
- ✅ Service no longer crashes on parsing errors
- ✅ Gracefully handles missing AI configuration
- ✅ Always returns valid career trajectory data (AI or fallback)
- ✅ Better error messages for debugging
- ✅ Improved reliability for production use

## Testing
Run the test to verify the fix:
```bash
node test-trajectory-fix.js
```

Or test the endpoint directly (with server running):
```bash
node test-career-endpoint.js
```

The service will now work reliably whether Vertex AI is configured or not, providing either AI-generated predictions or intelligent fallback responses.
