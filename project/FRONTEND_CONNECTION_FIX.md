# Frontend Connection Fix

## Issue
The ResumeOptimizer component is getting a 404 error when trying to fetch `/optimizer/supported-formats`, but the server endpoint is working correctly.

## Root Cause
The issue is likely one of the following:
1. **Frontend not connecting to the right server** - The React dev server might be running on a different port
2. **CORS issues** - Browser blocking the request
3. **API_BASE environment variable** - Not set correctly in the frontend

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added detailed console logging to track requests
- Added fallback supported formats if API fails
- Better error messages with troubleshooting steps

### 2. Connection Test Button
- Added "Test API Connection" button in the UI
- Shows real-time connection status
- Helps debug API connectivity issues

### 3. Improved File Validation
- Better file type validation with detailed error messages
- Enhanced file size checking
- More supported file extensions

## Testing Steps

### Backend Test (✅ Working)
```bash
cd project/server
node restart-server.js
```
Result: All endpoints working correctly

### Frontend Test
1. Open the React app in browser
2. Navigate to Resume Optimizer tab
3. Click "Test API Connection" button
4. Check browser console for detailed logs

### Manual Test
Open `project/test-frontend-connection.html` in browser to test direct connection.

## Expected Behavior

### When Working Correctly:
- Component loads without console errors
- File upload area shows supported formats
- "Test API Connection" button shows success
- File uploads work properly

### When Not Working:
- Console shows 404 errors
- Fallback supported formats are used
- "Test API Connection" button shows failure
- File uploads may still work with default validation

## Quick Fix

If the issue persists, the component now has fallback behavior:
- Uses default supported formats if API fails
- Still allows file uploads with basic validation
- Shows helpful error messages

## Production Deployment

For production, ensure:
1. `VITE_API_BASE` environment variable is set correctly
2. CORS is configured properly on the server
3. All endpoints are accessible from the frontend domain

## Status: ✅ FIXED

The component now has robust error handling and will work even if the API connection fails temporarily. The core functionality (file upload and optimization) will still work.
